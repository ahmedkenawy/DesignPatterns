  **Creational Design Pattern**
Creational design patterns deal with the process of object creation in software design. They provide mechanisms for creating objects in a manner that is flexible, efficient, and promotes decoupling of the client code from the objects being created. Creational design patterns often involve abstraction of the instantiation process, allowing a system to be independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.

Here are some common creational design patterns:

1.  **Singleton Pattern:**
    -   Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. It is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.
2.  **Factory Method Pattern:**   
    -   Defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created. It provides an interface for creating instances of a class, with its subclasses deciding which class to instantiate.
3.  **Abstract Factory Pattern:**
    -   Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It is useful when a system must be independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.
4.  **Builder Pattern:**
    -   Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create various representations. It is particularly useful when an object needs to be constructed with numerous possible configurations.
5.  **Prototype Pattern:**
    -   Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype. It is useful when the cost of creating a new instance of an object is more expensive than copying an existing instance.

Each creational design pattern addresses specific concerns related to object creation, instantiation, and composition. The choice of which pattern to use depends on the requirements and constraints of the specific problem at hand. These patterns help improve code flexibility, maintainability, and the overall design of the system.

 - [ ] Singleton Design Pattern
   
The Singleton Design Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. It is a creational pattern that is often used when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system, such as a configuration manager, logging service, or a connection pool.

Here are the key features and characteristics of the Singleton Design Pattern:
1.  **Single Instance:**
    -   The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
2.  **Global Access Point:**
        -   It provides a global point of access to the single instance, making it easy to reach from anywhere in the application.
3.  **Lazy Initialization:**
    -   The instance is usually created only when it is first needed (lazy initialization). This helps improve performance by avoiding unnecessary instantiation.
4.  **Private Constructor:**
    -   The Singleton class typically has a private constructor to prevent direct instantiation from outside the class.
5.  **Static Instance Method:**
    -   The class often provides a static method (e.g., `getInstance()`) that returns the singleton instance. This method is responsible for creating the instance if it does not exist.

**~~life_without_singleton~~**

    public  class  Authentication {
    // No static variable for a single instance  
    public  Authentication(){ 
    // Constructor can be used for instantiation
    }
    // No getInstance method  
    // Other methods and properties as needed }
Now you can create instances of `Authentication` using its public constructor:

    Authentication auth1 = new Authentication();
    Authentication auth2 = new Authentication();
    
    // auth1 and auth2 are independent instances
